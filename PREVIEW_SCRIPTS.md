## What the Scripts Do

All preview scripts perform the following actions:

1. **Check for npm**: Verifies that Node.js and npm are installed
2. **Install Dependencies**: If `node_modules` doesn't exist, runs `npm install`
3. **Start Server**: Launches the development server on port 3000
4. **Open Browser**: Automatically opens http://localhost:3000 in your default browser
5. **Keep Running**: Keeps the server running until you press Ctrl+C

## Troubleshooting

### Script won't run (Permission denied)

On Linux/macOS, you may need to make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x preview.sh
```

### PowerShell execution policy error

If you get an execution policy error, you can temporarily allow scripts:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### npm not found

Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ which includes npm.

### Port 3000 already in use

Stop any other applications using port 3000, or modify the `PORT` environment variable:
```bash
PORT=3001 ./preview.sh  # Linux/macOS
```

```powershell
$env:PORT=3001; .\preview.ps1  # PowerShell
```

## Manual Alternative

If you prefer to run the commands manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

## Server Features

The development server includes:
- Static file serving
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- SPA routing fallback to `index.html`
- Request logging
- Error handling

## Stopping the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the script is running to stop the server gracefully.
