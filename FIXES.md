# Service Configuration Fixes

## Issue Summary
The repository had several configuration and service integration issues that prevented the dual-service architecture from working properly.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Missing npm Scripts
Several npm scripts were referenced in documentation but not defined in `package.json`:
- `npm run setup` - Setup environment and dependencies
- `npm run dev:docker` - Start all services with Docker Compose
- `npm run dev:n8n` - Start only n8n and postgres services
- `npm run health-check` - Run health check diagnostics
- `npm run deploy:railway` - Deploy to Railway.app

### 2. Health Check Script Issues
The `health-check.js` file used CommonJS syntax (`require`) but the project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json), causing it to fail with:
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope
```

### 3. Railway Configuration Issues
The `railway.toml` file had conflicting service definitions:
- Duplicate/conflicting top-level `[build]` and `[deploy]` sections
- Missing explicit `dockerfilePath` and `image` specifications
- Unclear service separation causing confusion about whether services should be merged

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Missing npm Scripts
Updated `package.json` to include all referenced scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "npm install && cp -n .env.example .env || true",
    "dev:docker": "docker-compose up -d",
    "dev:n8n": "docker-compose up -d n8n postgres",
    "health-check": "node health-check.js",
    "deploy:railway": "railway up"
  }
}
```

### 2. Converted Health Check to ES Modules
Updated `health-check.js` to use ES module syntax:

**Before:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
// ...
module.exports = HealthCheckAgent;
```

**After:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
// ...
export default HealthCheckAgent;
```

### 3. Fixed Railway Service Configuration
Cleaned up `railway.toml` to have three distinct, properly configured services:

**Before:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
# ... conflicting with services below

[[services]]
name = "n8n-workflow-builder"
# ... missing dockerfilePath
```

**After:**
```toml
[[services]]
name = "n8n-workflow-builder"
icon = "🚀"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[[services]]
name = "n8n"
icon = "⚡"
dockerfilePath = "n8n.Dockerfile"

[[services]]
name = "postgres"
icon = "🐘"
image = "postgres:15-alpine"
```

## Service Architecture

The project now has a clear three-service architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Frontend Service   │
│  (n8n-workflow-     │
│   builder)          │
│  Port: 3000/8080    │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐
│   n8n Service       │───▶│  PostgreSQL DB      │
│   (Workflow Engine) │    │  (Data Storage)     │
│   Port: 5678        │    │  Port: 5432         │
└─────────────────────┘    └─────────────────────┘
```

### Service Details

1. **n8n-workflow-builder** (Frontend)
   - Built from: `Dockerfile`
   - Port: 3000 (production) or 8080 (docker-compose)
   - Purpose: Visual workflow builder interface
   - Dependencies: n8n service, postgres database

2. **n8n** (Workflow Execution Engine)
   - Built from: `n8n.Dockerfile`
   - Port: 5678
   - Purpose: Execute workflows created in frontend
   - Dependencies: postgres database

3. **postgres** (Database)
   - Image: `postgres:15-alpine`
   - Port: 5432
   - Purpose: Store workflow definitions and execution history
   - Dependencies: None

## Testing

All services can now be started using the documented commands:

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup environment
npm run setup

# Start all services
npm run dev:docker

# Start only n8n and database
npm run dev:n8n

# Check service health
npm run health-check
```

### Railway Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all three services
npm run deploy:railway
```

## Impact

✅ Documentation now matches implementation
✅ All npm scripts work as documented
✅ Health check script runs successfully
✅ Railway configuration is clean and unambiguous
✅ Three distinct services are properly configured
✅ No service merging needed - architecture is correct as-is

## Files Changed

1. `health-check.js` - Converted to ES modules
2. `package.json` - Added missing scripts
3. `railway.toml` - Fixed service configuration
4. `health-report.json` - Updated by health check run

## Verification

Run the following to verify all fixes:

```bash
# Verify scripts exist
npm run

# Test health check
npm run health-check

# Validate docker-compose
docker-compose config

# Check Railway config (requires Railway CLI)
railway status
```
