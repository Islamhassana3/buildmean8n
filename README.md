# Build Mean8n - Natural Language Workflow Builder

A powerful, intuitive workflow builder and editor with natural language capabilities, inspired by n8n. Build automation workflows using drag-and-drop or simply describe what you want in plain English!

> **Repository status (Sep 2025):** The project is currently migrating into a TypeScript-first npm workspace. Daily Git workflows—branching, committing, and pushing—still work exactly the same. See [`docs/CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md) for up-to-date contributor instructions while the new `apps/*` and `packages/*` scaffolds land.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Islamhassana3/buildmean8n.git
   cd buildmean8n
   ```

2. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or simply open `index.html` in your browser.

3. **Start building**:
   - Use the chat panel to describe your workflow
   - Or drag nodes from the "Nodes" tab to the canvas
   - Connect nodes by clicking on connection points
   - Test your workflow with the "Execute" button

### Dual-Service Architecture Setup

Build Mean8n now supports a production-ready dual-service architecture with n8n + PostgreSQL:

#### Local Development with Docker

1. **Setup environment**:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   # Configure your .env file with database credentials
   ```

2. **Start all services**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:docker
   ```

   This starts:
   - Frontend (Build Mean8n) on http://localhost:8080
   - n8n service on http://localhost:5678
   - PostgreSQL database on port 5432

3. **Start n8n only**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:n8n
   ```

#### Railway.app Deployment

1. **Install Railway CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Deploy**:

   ```bash
   railway login
   npm run deploy:railway
   ```

   This deploys three services:
   - **Frontend**: Build Mean8n workflow builder
   - **n8n**: Workflow execution engine
   - **PostgreSQL**: Database for workflow persistence

#### Environment Variables

Key configuration for dual-service setup:

```bash
# n8n Service Connection
N8N_API_URL=http://localhost:5678
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/n8n
DB_TYPE=postgresdb

# Security
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
```

#### Service Health Checks

Monitor your services:

```bash
npm run health-check
```

Services include automatic health monitoring:

- Frontend application health
- n8n service connectivity
- Database connection status
- Workflow execution capabilities

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Natural Language

In the chat panel, type:

```
"Send email when form submitted"
```

The AI will automatically create a workflow with:

- Webhook trigger (to receive form data)
- Send Email action (to send the notification)

### Example 2: Drag & Drop

1. Switch to the "Nodes" tab
2. Drag a "Schedule" trigger to the canvas
3. Drag an "HTTP Request" action to the canvas
4. Click the output point on Schedule and the input point on HTTP Request to connect them
5. Click "Execute" to test

### Example 3: Complex Workflows

In the chat, try:

```
"Slack notification on new tweet"
```

This creates:

- Schedule trigger (checks for new tweets)
- HTTP Request (calls Twitter API)
- Slack action (sends notification)

## 🎯 Key Features in Detail
